## Heya, I'm Michele

Iâ€™m a **researcher** in particle physics and a produ nerd since it was not mainstream.

---

## Research
 
I focus on **Particle Physics Phenomenology**, in particular on theories Beyond the Standard Model, ranging from neutrino to dark matter and flavor physics. 

I am currently a **Postdoc** at the Galileo Galilei Institute for Theoretical Physics, beautifully located on top of the Arcetri hill in Firenze, Italy.

By the way, here is my CV (which I may have forgot to update recently)

If all these word on physics are meaningless to you, I'm trying to write out a basic understanding in some of the posts [here](https://miketamma.github.io)

<!-- **Fun Fact**  
I probably drink too much coffee
