## Heya, I'm Michele

I’m a **researcher** in particle physics and a proud nerd since it was not mainstream.

## Research
 
I focus on **Particle Physics Phenomenology**, in particular on theories Beyond the Standard Model, ranging from neutrino to dark matter and flavor physics. 

I am currently a **Postdoc** at the Galileo Galilei Institute for Theoretical Physics, beautifully located on top of the Arcetri hill in Firenze, Italy.

By the way, here is my CV (which I may have forgot to update recently)

If all these physics terms feel unfamiliar, don’t worry — I’m writing posts that explain the basics in simple terms. You can find them [here](/404.html)
