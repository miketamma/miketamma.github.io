I’m a **researcher** in particle physics and a proud nerd since it was not mainstream.

---

## Research
 
My research work focuses on **Particle Physics Phenomenology**, in particular on theories Beyond the Standard Model, ranging from neutrino to dark matter and flavor physics. 

I am currently a **Postdoc** at the Galileo Galilei Institute for Theoretical Physics, beautifully located on top of the Arcetri hill in Firenze, Italy.

### Quick facts

- Working in theoretical high energy physics
- My list of publications is on [InspireHEP](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1868970)
- **Postdoc** at the GGI, Firenze, since June 2025
- Before, I was **Postdoc** at the INFN, Firenze, 2023 - 2025, and at the Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, 2020 - 2023
- **PhD** in particle physics theory, 2020, at the University of Cincinnati, Ohio, USA

By the way, here is my full CV (which I may have forgot to update recently)

## Blogging

Maybe I will start writing consistently, maybe not.

If all these physics terms are meaningless to you, don’t worry — I’m planning to write posts that explain the basics in simple terms. You can find them [here](/404.html)
